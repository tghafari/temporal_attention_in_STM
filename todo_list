Significancy analyses for predictability pooled AND predictable vs. unpredictable + short vs. long (SCORE/IES/RT_correct/confidence)

  Performance group (median-split) significancy analyses for both experiments for predictable vs. unpredictable 
  Difficulty levels (4,6,8,10 AND 4,8)
  Positions (positions, quads, hemifields) -> round to the 3 significant digits (x and y two categories for ANOVA)

inter-individual difference to help argue for our (robust) significant findings (significancy check)  -> exp. 1 & score in exp.2s (ANOVA)
