rm-ANOVA for second part (predictable vs. unpredictable in both experiments) ✔️

Significancy analyses for predictability pooled AND predictable vs. unpredictable + short vs. long
  difference between positions (regression)
  difference between quads -> round to the 3rd float position
  difference between hemifields -> round to the 3rd float position
  
Performance group (median-split) significancy analyses for both experiments for predictable vs. unpredictable -> double check performance groups (median split on score median on diff =8 ✔️)
  Difficulty levels (4,6,8,10 AND 4,8)
  Positions (positions, quads, hemifields)
  
TPR for short-long and predictable-unpredictable conditions on radar charts ✔️

Radar charts for RT_correct and IES ✔️

Supp: confidence levels -> think about it later

#normalization -> think about it later

Last priority: inter-individual difference to help argue for our (robust) significant findings (significancy check)  -> exp. 1 & score in exp.2s
