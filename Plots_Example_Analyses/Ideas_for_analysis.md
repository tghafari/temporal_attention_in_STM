Suggested analyses:

use tachymetric functions (performance vs. reaction time)

Could use memory capacity formulas:
1) Cowan's formula (Cowan, 2001) -> K = SS * (H + C – 1), where SS represents set size, H represents hit rate, and C represents correct rejection rate.
2) Pashler’s formula (Pashler,1988) -> K <sub>p</sub> = SS * ((H + FA)/(1 – FA)), where SS represents set size, H represents hit rate, and FA represents the false alarm rate.

Weibull functions were fit to each observer’s data using maximum likelihood estimation to derive the 75%-correct contrast threshold for the orientation discrimination task, for each location and stimulus condition (Prins & Kingdom, 2018):

 ψ = γ + (1 − γ − λ) (1 − e <sup>-(x/α)<sup>β</sup></sup>)

where ψ is proportion of correct responses, x is the contrast of the stimulus, γ is the guessing rate is which was set to 50%, λ is the lapse rate, which was held constant at 0.01, α is the contrast threshold, and β is the slope (Himmelberg et al, 2020, JoV).
